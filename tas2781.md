## 3 Description
The TAS2781 is a mono, digital input Class-D audio amplifier optimized for efficiently driving high peak power into loudspeakers. The Class-D amplifier is capable of delivering 25 W of continuous power into a 4 Ω load with less than 1% THD+N at a supply voltage of 18 V. The broad voltage input range and the high output power makes this amplifier versatile enough to work with battery or line powered systems.

An on-chip DSP supports Texas Instruments Smart Amp speaker protection algorithm. The integrated speaker voltage and current sense provides for real-time monitoring of loudspeakers.

Y-Bridge power architecture improves amplifier efficiency by internally selecting the supplies for optimal headroom. Brownout prevention scheme with adjustable threshold allows reducing the gain in signal path when the supply drops.

The Hybrid-Pro algorithm allows user to optimize efficiency and improve battery life by controlling the external power supply.

Up to eight TAS2781 devices can share a common bus via I²S/TDM and I²C/SPI interfaces.

The TAS2781 is available in a 30 pin HR-QFN package for a compact PCB footprint.

## 7 Parameter Measurement Information

The typical characteristics for the device are measured using the Bench Evaluation Module (EVM) and an Audio Precision Analyzer. A PSIA interface is used to allow the I2S interface to be driven directly into the Audio Precision Analyzer.

In some measurements (THD+N, ICN, DNR, and so forth), Class-D output terminals are connected to the Audio Precision Analyzer analog inputs through a Differential-to-Single Ended (D2S) filter as shown below. The D2S filter contains a second-order passive pole at 120 kHz and an instrumentation amplifier. The D2S filter ensures the TAS2781 high-performance Class-D amplifier has its outputs filtered and buffered before processed. This prevents measurement errors due to loading effects of AUX-00XX filter on the Class-D outputs.

## 8 Detailed Description

### 8.1 Overview

| Voltage Monitor | 23 V |
| Current Sense | 5 A |
| Voltage Sense | 16 Vpk |

### 8.2 Functional Block Diagram

[Image: A functional block diagram of the TAS2781 device, showing various components and their interconnections]

### 8.3 Feature Description
### 8.3.1 MODE Selection

TAS2781 has two modes of operation selected based on the setting of the pin 26 (MODE) - see table below.

| Amplifier Mode | Control Interface | Pin 26 (MODE) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Smart Amp | I<sup>2</sup>C | Connected to GND |
| Smart Amp | SPI | 470 Ω to GND |

### 8.3.2 Device Address Selection

The TAS2781 operates using a TDM/I<sup>2</sup>S interface. Audio input and output are provided via the FSYNC, SBCLK, SDIN and SDOUT pins using formats including I<sup>2</sup>S, Left Justified and TDM. Configuration and status are provided using the I<sup>2</sup>C protocol (MODE pin tied to GND) or SPI protocol MODE pin connected to GND through a 470 Ohms.

The table below illustrates how to configure the device for I<sup>2</sup>C address. The peripheral addresses are shown left shifted by one bit with the R/W bit set to 0 (for example, {ADDR\[6:0\],1'b0}). Resistors with tolerance better than 5% must be used for setting the address configuration.

| I<sup>2</sup>C Address | 0x70 | 0x72 | 0x74 | 0x76 | 0x78 | 0x7A | 0x7C | 0x7E |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ADDR PIN | Short to GND | 470 Ω to GND | 470 Ω to AVDD | 2.2 kΩ to GND | 2.2 kΩ to AVDD | 10 kΩ to GND | 10 kΩ to AVDD | Short to AVDD |

The TAS2781 has a global 7-bit I<sup>2</sup>C address 0x80. When bit I2C_GLB_EN of register from is set high the device will respond to I<sup>2</sup>C commands at this address regardless of the ADDR pin settings. This is used to speed up device configuration when using multiple TAS2781 devices and programming similar settings across all devices. The I<sup>2</sup>C ACK / NACK cannot be used during the multi-device writes since multiple devices are responding to the I<sup>2</sup>C command. The I<sup>2</sup>C CRC function should be used to ensure each device properly received the I<sup>2</sup>C commands. At the completion of writing multiple devices using the global address, the CRC at I2C_CKSUM register should be checked on each device using the local address for a proper value. The global I<sup>2</sup>C address can be disabled using I2C_GLB_EN register bit. The I<sup>2</sup>C address is detected by automatically sampling the

the address pins state when the SDZ pin is released. Additionally, the address may be re-detected by setting the I2C_AD_DET register bit high after power up and the ADDR pin will be re-sampled.

### 8.3.3 SPI Interface

TAS2781 features an 1.8 V SPI interface when pin 26 (MODE) is connected to GND through a 470 Ω resistor. Pin 17 (NC_V1P8) of the device needs to be tied to an 1.8 V supply.

The host controller should use the mode with CPHA = 1 and CPOL = 0. The TAS2781 SPI logic block is sampling SPI input data on falling edge of SPI clock and transmitting SPI output data on rising edge of SPI clock.

### 8.3.4 Register Organization

Device configuration and coefficients are stored using a page and book scheme. Each page contains 128 bytes and each book contains 256 pages. All device configuration registers are stored in book 0 which is the default setting at power up and after a software reset. The book and page can be set by the BOOK\[7:0\] bits of register from and PAGE\[7:0\] bits of register from .

**Note**

Programming register bits from book 0x00, pages 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x08 and 0x0A needs to be done in groups of four registers (32 bit format), each byte corresponding to an 8 bit register and with less significant byte corresponding to the highest register address. For instance , when programming the limiter maximum threshold in registers from , the MSBs will be in register 0x10 and the LSBs in register 0x13.

### 8.4 Device Functional Modes

#### 8.4.1 TDM Serial Audio Port

The TAS2781 provides a flexible TDM serial audio port. The port can be configured to support a variety of formats including stereo I²S, Left Justified and TDM. Mono audio playback is available via the SDIN pin. The SDOUT pin is used to transmit sample streams including PVDDL voltage, PVDH voltage, die temperature, status, audio for echo cancelation.

By default, the TAS2781 will automatically detect the PCM playback sample rate (AUTO_RATE = 0). This can be disabled and manually configured by setting the AUTO_RATE bit of register to high.

The TDM serial audio port valid SBLCK to FSYNC ratios are presented in register in . The device will automatically detect the number of time slots and it does not need to be programmed.

The SAMP_RATE\[2:0\] and SBLCK_FS_RATIO\[5:0\] register bits are used to configure the PCM audio sample rate when AUTO_RATE register bit is high (auto detection of TDM sample rate is disabled). The TAS2781 employs a robust clock fault detection engine that will automatically volume ramp down the playback path if FSYNC does not match the configured sample rate (if AUTO_RATE = 1) or the ratio of SBLCK to FSYNC is not supported (minimizing any audible artifacts). Once the clocks are detected to be valid in both frequency and ratio, the device will automatically volume ramp the playback path back to the configured volume and resume playback.

When using the auto rate detection the sampling rate and SBLCK to FSYNC ratio detected on the TDM bus is reported back on the read-only bits FS_RATIO\[5:0\] and FS_RATE\[2:0\] of registers in ] and in .

A frame begins with the transition of FSYNC from either high to low or low to high (set by the FRAME_START register bit). FSYNC and SDIN are sampled by SBLCK using either the rising or falling edge (set by the RX_EDGE register bit). The RX_OFF\[4:0\] register bits define the number of SBLCK cycles from the transition of FSYNC until the beginning of time slot 0. This is typically set to a value of 0 for Left Justified format and 1 for an I²S format.

The RX_SLEN\[1:0\] register bits set the length of the RX time slot to 16, 24 or 32 (default) bits. The length of the audio sample word within the time slot is configured by the RX_WLEN\[1:0\] register bits. The RX port will left justify the audio sample within the time slot by default, but this can be changed to right justification via the RX_JSTF register bit. The TAS2781 supports mono and stereo down mix playback (|L+R|/2). By default the device will playback mono from the time slot equal to the I²C base address offset (set by the ADDR pin) for

stereo down mix playback (|L+R|/2). By default the device will playback mono from the time slot equal to the I²C base address offset (set by the ADDR pin).

### Playback Configuration and Transmission Details

The RX_SCFG\[1:0\] register bits can be used to override the playback source to the left time slot, right time slot, or stereo down mix set by the RX_SLOT_R\[3:0\] and RX_SLOT_L\[3:0\] register bits.

If time slot selection places reception either partially or fully beyond the frame boundary, the receiver will return a null sample equivalent to a digitally muted sample.

The TDM port can transmit a number of sample streams on the SDOUT pin: speaker voltage sense, speaker current sense, interrupts, and status, PVDDH voltage, and die temperature.

Either the rising or falling edge of SBLCK can be used to transmit data on the SDOUT pin. This can be configured by setting the TX_EDGE register bit. The TX_OFF\[2:0\] register bits define the number of SBLCK cycles between the start of a frame and the beginning of time slot 0. This would typically be programmed to 0 for Left Justified format and 1 for I²S format. The TDM TX can either transmit logic 0 or Hi-Z depending on the setting of the TX_FILL register bit. An optional bus keeper will weakly hold the state of SDOUT pin when all devices are driving Hi-Z. Since only one bus keeper is required on SDOUT, this feature can be disabled via the TX_KEEPEN register bit. The bus keeper can be configured to hold the bus for only 1 LSB or Always (permanent) using TX_KEEPLN register bit. Additionally, the keeper LSB can be driven for a full cycle or half of a cycle using TX_KEEPCY register bit.

TX_FILL is used in mono systems where there is only one amplifier on the I²S bus. All the slots unused by the amplifier will be filled with zeros when TX_FILL is set to low. The TX bits mentioned are in the register.

The SDOUT_HIZ registers from page 0x01 are useful when multiple devices are on the same I²S bus. Each device does not know the configuration of slots in the other devices on the bus. It is required at the system level to program the SDOUT_HIZ registers appropriately, so that the settings are done correctly and do not create any contention both internally and externally.

The current and voltage values are transmitted at the full 16-bit measured values by default. The IVMON_EN\[1:0\] bits of the register can be used to transmit only the 8 MSB bits in one slot or 12 MSB bits across multiple slots. The special 12-bit mode is used when only 24-bit I²S/TDM data can be processed by the host processor. The device should be configured with the voltage-sense slot and current-sense slot offset by 1 slot and will consume 3 consecutive 8-bit slots. In this mode, the device will transmit the first 12 MSB bits followed by the second 12 MSB bits specified by the preceding slot.

If time slot selections place transmission beyond the frame boundary, the transmitter will truncate transmission at the frame boundary.

The time slots for SAR measurements (PVDD, PVDDH, and temperature) are set using SAR_DATA_SLOT\[5:0\] register bits. To enable the sample stream register bit SAR_DATA_TX must be set high. The slot length is selected by bit SAR_DATA_SL of the register.

For TDM final processed audio slot, enable and length settings use AUDIO_SLOT\[5:0\], AUDIO_TX, and AUDIO_SLEN register bits.

Information about the status of slots can be found in STATUS_SLOT\[5:0\] register bits. STATUS_TX register bit set high enables the status transmit.

### Playback Signal Path

#### Digital Signal Processor

An on-chip, low latency DSP supports Texas Instrument Smart Amp speaker protection algorithms to maximize loudness while maintaining safe speaker conditions.

The DSP also features Band EQ, stereo balancing, ultrasound, and an external boost controller for Class-H amplifier operation.

#### High Pass Filter

Excessive DC and low-frequency content in the audio playback signal can damage loudspeakers. The TAS2781 employs a high-pass filter (HPF) to prevent this from occurring for the PCM playback path. The HPF_FREQ_PB\[2:0\] register bits set the corner frequencies of HPF. The filter can be bypassed by setting the register bits to 3'b000.

### Amplifier Inversion

The TAS2781 will output a non-inverted signal to the OUT_P and OUT_N pins. The output can be inverted with respect to the digital input value by setting the `AMP_INV` register bit to high.

### Digital Volume Control and Amplifier Output Level

The gain from audio input to speaker terminals is controlled by setting the amplifier output level and the digital volume control (DVC).

Amplifier output level settings are programmed using the `AMP_LVL[4:0]` register bits. The amplifier levels are presented in the register from. The Digital Volume Control (DVC) is set by default to 0 dB. It should be noted that these levels may not be achievable because of analog clipping in the amplifier, so they should be used only to convey gain.

Equation (1) calculates amplifier output voltage:

$$
V_{AMP} = INPUT + A_{DVC} + A_{AMP}
$$

where
* $V_{AMP}$ is the amplifier output voltage in dBV
* $INPUT$ is the digital input amplitude as a number of dB with respect to 0 dBFS
* $A_{DVC}$ is the digital volume control setting as a number of dB
* $A_{AMP}$ is the amplifier output level setting as a number of dBV

The DVC is configurable from 0 dB to -100 dB in 0.5 dB steps by setting the `DVC_LVL[7:0]` register bits. Settings greater than C8h are interpreted as mute. When a change in digital volume control occurs, the device ramps the volume to the new setting based on the `DVC_SLEW[31:0]` register bits status from. The bits `DVC_RMP_RT[1:0]` of register in enable or disable the volume ramp control.

The Class-D amplifier uses a closed-loop architecture. The approximate threshold for output signal clipping is given by equation (2).

$$
V_{PK} = V_{SUP} * \frac{R_L}{R_{FET} + R_P + R_L}
$$

where:
* $V_{PK}$ is the maximum peak un-clipped output voltage in V
* $V_{SUP}$ is the power supply of Class-D output stage
* $R_L$ is the speaker load in Ω
* $R_P$ is the parasitic resistance on PCB (routing, filters) in Ω
* $R_{FET}$ is the power stage total resistance (HS FET, LS FET, Sense Resistor, bonding, packaging) in Ω

When PVDDL supplies Class-D output stage typical $R_{FET}$ value is 0.5 Ω. For PVDDH supply $R_{FET}$ typical value is 0.25 Ω.

### PVDDL Supply

The TAS2781 can operate with or without a PVDDL supply. When configured without a PVDDL supply, the PVDDH voltage will be used with an internal LDO to generate this supply voltage. A decoupling capacitor should still be populated as recommended in Table 9-1. In this case, `PVDDL_MODE` bit should be set to high before transitioning from Software Shutdown mode. More details about PVDDL supply modes of operation can be found in Section 11.1.

### Y - Bridge

The TAS2781 Class-D output uses a Y-Bridge configuration to improve efficiency during playback. The LVS () is internally used to select between the PVDDH and PVDDL supplies. This feature is enabled by setting `CDS_MODE[1:0]` bits to 2'b00 when both PVDDH and PVDDL are supplied to the device. If not configured to

operate using only PVDDH to supply Class-D output. In this configuration the PVDDL can be provided from external supply (register bit `PVDDL_MODE=0`) or generated by an internal LDO (register bit `PVDDL_MODE[7]=1`). In this case `CDS_MODE[7:6]` bits should be set to `2'b10`. The TAS2781 Y-Bridge with low power on PVDDL can be used to switch to the PVDDL rail only at very low power when close to idle. This will reduce the Class-D output swing when near idle and limit the current requirements of the PVDDL supply. Set the `CDS_MODE[7:6]` register to `2'b11` for this mode.

See Section 11.1 for details on programming the power mode of operation.

The change to the Class-D supply (PVDDL to PVDDH) determined by the LVS has a delay with respect to input signal crossing threshold and it can be programmed using `CDS_DLY[7:0]` bits of register.

When in Y-Bridge mode, if the PVDDH falls below (PVDDL + 2.5 V) level, the Y-Bridge will stop switching between supplies and will remain on the PVDDH supply.

### 8.4.2.7 Low Voltage Signaling (LVS)

The TAS2781 is a mechanism used in connection with the Y Bridge configuration of the output stage of Class-D. It is based on monitoring the absolute value of the audio stream and selecting the proper supply, PVDDH or PVDDL.

When the signal is initially above the programmed LVS threshold the Class-D is supplied by PVDDH rail. If the signal level drops below this threshold for longer than the hysteresis time defined by `LVS_HYS[3:0]` register bits, the Class-D supply will switch to PVDDL. If the signal goes back to the initial level the Class-D supply will switch back to PVDDH.

By default, the LVS threshold is configured to be a value relative to the PVDDL voltage (`LVS_DET = 1`). Use the `LVS_RTH[3:0]` register bits for setting the threshold (default = 0.7 V).

Setting bit `LVS_DET` bit to low forces the LVS threshold to a fixed value defined by the `LVS_FTH[4:0]` register bits.

LVS threshold is referred relative to the output signal level and it is measured in dBFS.

In an use case when `CDS_MODE[1:0]=11` (`PWR_MODE2` from Section 11.1), the fixed LVS threshold can be set using register bits `LVS_TH_LOW[1:0]`.

### 8.4.2.8 Noise Gate Mode

The TAS2781 has a noise-gate feature that monitors the input signal and powers down the Class-D when the signal goes below the set threshold set by `NG_TH[1:0]` bits for longer than the time set by `NG_HYST_TIMER[2:0]` bits of register. When the signal goes above the threshold the Class-D will re-power in seven samples before the samples applied to the audio input interface reach the Class-D output.

The Noise Gate feature is enabled by setting `NG_EN` bit to high. Once enabled it is able to power up and down the channel within the device processing delay requiring no additional external control. Volume ramping can be also used during noise gate operations by setting `NG_DVC_RP` bit to low.

The noise gate can be configured with finer resolution at the expense of additional I2C writes. Use `NGFR_EN` bit to enable this mode and register bits `NGFR_LVL[23:0]` from to set the fine resolution. The fine resolution hysteresis is set using `NGFR_HYST[18:3]` register bits from and from.

### 8.4.2.9 Supply Tracking Limiter

The TAS2781 monitors PVDDH supply voltage and the audio signal to automatically decrease gain when the audio signal peaks exceed a programmable threshold. This helps prevent clipping and extends playback time through end of charge battery conditions. The limiter threshold can be configured to track PVDDH below a programmable inflection point with a programmable slope. A minimum threshold sets the limit of threshold reduction from PVDDH tracking.

The limiter is enabled by setting the `LIM_EN` bit register to high.

Configurable attack rate, hold time and release rate are provided to shape the dynamic response of the limiter (`LIM_ATK[3:0]`, `LIM_HLD[2:0]` and `LIM_RLS[3:0]` bits of registers).

A maximum level of attenuation applied by the limiter is configurable via the `LIM_MAX_AT[3:0]` bits of register. If the limiter is attacking and if it reaches the maximum attenuation, gain will not be reduced any further.

The limiter begins reducing gain when the output signal level is greater than the limiter threshold. The limiter can be configured to track PVDDH below a programmable inflection point with a minimum threshold value. shows the limiter configured to limit to a constant level regardless of PVDDH level. To achieve this behavior, set the limiter maximum threshold to the desired level via the `LIM_MAX_TH[31:0]` register bits. Set the limiter inflection point (register bits `LIM_INF[31:0]`) below the minimum allowable PVDDH setting. The limiter minimum threshold, set by register bits `LIM_MIN_TH[31:0]`, does not impact limiter behavior in this use case.

[Image: Four graphs illustrating different limiter configurations: Figure 8-1 Limiter with Fixed Threshold, Figure 8-2 Limiter with Inflection Point, Figure 8-3 Limiter with Dynamic Threshold, and Figure 8-4 Limiter with Inflection Point and Minimum Threshold]

shows how to configure the limiter to track PVDDH below a threshold without a minimum threshold. Set the `LIM_MAX_TH[31:0]` register bits to the desired threshold and `LIM_INF[31:0]` register bits to the desired inflection point where the limiter will begin reducing the threshold with PVDDH. The `LIM_SLP[31:0]` register bits can be used to change the slope of the limiter tracking with PVDDH. The default value of 1 V/V will reduce the threshold 1 V for every 1 V of drop in PVDDH supply. More aggressive tracking slopes can be programmed if desired. Program the `LIM_MIN_TH[31:0]` bits below the minimum PVDDH to prevent the limiter from having a minimum threshold reduction when tracking PVDDH.

The limiter with a supply tracking slope can be configured in an alternate way. By setting `LIM_DYHDR` register bit to 1'b1 in register, a headroom can be specified as a percentage of the supply voltage using a 1V/V slope by setting `LIM_HDR[4:0]` register bits. For example if a headroom of -10% is specified, the peak output voltage will be set to be 10% higher than PVDDH. In this use case presented in the limiting begins for signals above the supply voltage and will result in a fixed clipping. If a positive headroom of +10% is specified the peak output

voltage will be dynamically set 10% below the current PVDDH. In this use case the limiting will begin at signal levels lower than the supply voltage and prevent clipping from occurring.

To achieve a limiter that tracks PVDDH only up to a minimum threshold, configure the limiter `LIM_MAX_TH[31:0]` and `LIM_SLP[31:0]` register bits as in the previous examples. Then additionally set the `LIM_MIN_TH[31:0]` register bits to the desired minimum threshold. Supply voltage below this minimum threshold will not continue to decrease the signal output voltage.

By setting register bit `LIM_DYHDR` to low the limiter mechanism depends on settings for maximum and minimum thresholds, inflection point and slope. By default this bit is high and the limiter dynamic headroom is enabled.

### 8.4.2.10 Brownout Prevention

Brownout Prevention (BOP) feature provides a priority input to the limiter to generate a fast response to transient dips in supply voltage at end of charge conditions that can cause system level brownout. When supply voltage dips below the BOP threshold, the limiter begins reducing gain at a configurable attack rate. When supply voltage rises above the BOP threshold, the limiter will begin to release after the programmed hold time. The BOP feature can be enabled by setting the `BOP_EN[0]` register bit high. The brownout supply source can be set using `BOP_SRC` register bit to either PVDDH or PVDDL depending on application.

By default BOP supply source is set to PVDDL input and the SAR converter will digitize the PVDDH and PVDDL voltages and temperature. The PVDDH undervoltage detection will be disabled.

When BOP supply source is set to PVDDH input the SAR ADC converter will digitize the PVDDH and PVDDL volts and temperature. The PVDDH undervoltage detection will be enabled in this case.To reduce latency in the first attack of the BOP engine, PVDDL conversion can be bypassed by setting the register bit `CNV_PVDDL`to low.

When BOP supply source is set to PVDDL input the SAR converter will digitize the PVDDH and PVDDL voltages and temperature. The PVDDH undervoltage detection will be disabled.

When the BOP is engaging the Supply Tracking Limiter is paused.

The BOP threshold is set by the `BOP_TH[31:0]` bits from registers in. The setting of `BOP_MUTE` bit determines if once the supply goes below the threshold the device mutes audio and shuts down or just attenuates the audio signal whit no muting.

The TAS2781 can also immediately mute and then shutdown the device when a BOP event occurs by reaching the threshold set by the `BOPS_D_TH[31:0]` bits from registers in if the `BOPSD_EN` register bit is set high. This shutdown feature is auto disabled internally when `BOP_MUTE` is set high.

The BOP has programmable attack rate register bits `BOP_ATK[2:0]`, attack step size register bits `BOP_ATK_ST[1:0]` and hold time register bits `BOP_HLD[2:0])`.

When the system comes out of BOP the supply tracking limiter release will be engaged. If the limiter is disabled the gain will be released as per limiter release settings.

The hold time can be set to Infinite by programming the `BOP_INF_HLD` register bit to high. The device will need to transition through a mute or SW/HW shutdown state or the register bit `BOP_HLD_CLR` can be set to high (which will cause the device to exit the hold state and begin releasing).

When `BOP_INF_HLD` bit is set low the device will hold based on programming of `BOP_HLD[2:0]` bits.

### 8.4.2.11 ICC Pin and Inter-Chip Communication

The TAS2781 supports dual gain balancing in stereo applications. One device can be paired with only one other device in the system.

The ICC pin will be connected to an ICC bus with bus keeper. Pin 17 (NC_V1P8V) supplying ICC buffer needs to be connected to an 1.8 V supply.

The SDOUT pin cannot be used for gain alignment.

The `ICC_CFG[2:0]` bits of register from configure the functionality of the ICC pin.

## 8.4.2.12 Class-D Settings
### 8.4.2.12.1 Output Slew Rate Control

The output slew rate can be programmed using bits `EDGE_CTRL[1:0]` from register.

By default, if PVDDH supply is below 20 V the output slew rate will be at a fast rate, dependant on supply and load. If PVDDH goes above 20 V the slew rate will be automatically change to a slower rate.

Optionally, to improve EMI performance, user can set the slew rate to a slower rate for the entire range of PVDDH supply by setting the bits `EDGE_CTRL[1:0]` to 2'b11.

### 8.4.2.12.2 Synchronization

The TAS2781 Class-D amplifier supports spread spectrum PWM modulation, which can be enabled by setting the `AMP_SS` register bit high. This can help reduce EMI in the system.

By default, the Class-D amplifier switching frequency is based on the device trimmed internal oscillator. To synchronize switching to the audio sample rate, set the `CLASSD_SYNC` register bit high. When the Class-D is synchronized to the audio sample rate, the `RAMP_RATE` register bit must be set depending on the audio sample rate of either 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz (default) based frequency.

### 8.4.3 SAR ADC

A SAR ADC monitors PVDDH voltage, PVDDL voltage and die temperature. The results of these conversions are available via register readback (`PVDDH_CNV[11:0]`, `PVDDL_CNV[11:0]` and `TMP_CNV[7:0]` register bits). PVDDH and PVDDL voltage conversions are also used by the limiter and brown out prevention blocks.

By default, PVDDL conversion is enabled along with PVDDH and temperature in both cases, when BOP source is PVDDL (`BOP_SRC = 0`) or BOP source is PVDDH (`BOP_SRC = 1`).

The ADC runs at a fixed 192 kHz sample rate with a conversion time of 5.2 μs.

Temperature is sampled once every 18th SAR conversions. Sampling rate for temperature is approximative 10K samples/sec.

PVDDH and PVDDL voltages and the die temperature can be estimated by user using equations from registers , and .

The register bits content should always be read from MSB to LSB.

The voltage and temperature readings of SAR ADC are also available to the host through the SDOUT pin. Use bits of register from to enable this feature and configure the slots.

### 8.4.4 Current and Voltage (IV) Sense

The TAS2781 provides speaker voltage and current sense measurements for real-time monitoring of loudspeaker behavior. The VSNSP and VSNSN pins should be connected after any ferrite bead filter (or directly to the OUTP and OUTN connections if no EMI filter is used). The V-Sense connections eliminate voltage drop error due to packaging, PCB interconnect or ferrite bead filter resistance. It should be noted that any interconnect resistance after the VSNS terminals will not be corrected for, so it is advised to connect the sense connections as close to the load as possible.

The voltage and current sense internal ADCs have a DC blocking filter. This filter cut-off frequency can be adjusted, or the filter can be bypassed using the `HPF_FREQ_REC[2:0]` register bits.

I-Sense and V-Sense blocks can be powered up by setting the `ISNS_PD` and `VSNS_PD` register bits to low.

### 8.4.5 Post Filter Feed-Back (PFFB)

The device supports post-filter feedback by closing the amplifier feedback loop after the external filter. The feedback is applied using the VSNSN and VSNSP terminals of the device. This feature can be disabled using

the `PFFB_EN` register bit (if an external filter that violates the amplifier loop stability is implemented). When PFFB is disabled, the feedback will be internally routed from the OUTN and OUTP pins of the device.

In the PFFB mode of operation the following conditions have to be met: f<sub>0</sub> > 10 MHz and f<sub>0</sub>/Q > 2.5 MHz (f<sub>0</sub> and Q are the cutoff frequency and the quality factor of the external filter).

### 8.4.6 Thermal Foldback

The TAS2781 monitors the die temperature and can automatically limit the audio signal when the die temperature reaches a set threshold. It is recommended to use the thermal fold-back registers to configure this protection mechanism as the internal DSP will perform the necessary calculation for each register.

Thermal fold-back can be disabled using `TF_EN` bit. If the die temperature reaches the value set by `TF_TMP_TH[31:0]` bits of register from this feature will begin to attenuate the audio signal to prevent the device from shutting down due to over-temperature. It will attenuate the audio signal by a value set in `TF_SLP[31:0]` register bits over a range of temperature set by `TF_TMP_TH[31:0]` register bits. The thermal fold-back attack is set using the `TF_ATK[31:0]` register bits. However, a maximum attenuation can be specified using register bits `TF_MAX_ATN[31:0]`. However, if the device continue to heat up, eventually the device over-temperature will be triggered. The attenuation will be held for a number of samples set by register bits `TF_HLD[31:0]`, before the attenuation will begin releasing.

### 8.4.7 Over Power Protection

The TAS2781 monitors the temperature of the internal power FETs. If the maximum continue power is high and power FETs temperature goes above a threshold, an internal protection circuit will trigger a thermal foldback and, if temperature still incraeses, shutdown the device.

The protection mechanism is based on two thresholds TH1 and TH2. The TH1 threshold is set at a temperature 116 °C higher than the temperature measured by the internal bandgap but not less than 250 °C. The TH1 threshold triggers a thermal foldback.

The TH2 threshold is 40 °C above TH1 and triggers thermal shutdown.

The two detection mechanisms can be disabled by setting to low the bits `TG_TH2` and `TG_TH1`.

### 8.4.8 Low Battery Protection

For PVDDL supply below 3.4 V the power FETs can go into saturation at higher load currents which could result in device damage due to the FETs connected to PVDDH going into thermal runaway.

To prevent the damage the OCP limit is adjusted based on PVDDL level measured by the internal SAR ADC. The table below presents the PVDDL thresholds where the OCP will be adjusted automatically. Lower PVDDL level will correspond to lower OC limit setting.

| PVDDL Range         |
|---------------------|
| PVDDL $\geq$ 3.4 V  |
| 3.1 V $\leq$ PVDDL < 3.4 V |
| 2.9 V $\leq$ PVDDL < 3.1 V |
| 2.7 V $\leq$ PVDDL < 2.9 V |

The control of OC limit occurs in power modes where PVDDL is supplied externaly and the output is switching on PVDDH (PWR_MODE0, PWR_MODE1).

### 8.4.9 Battery Power Limiter

The TAS2781 integrates an algorithm that can control the audio power by regulating the current based on the battery voltage readout.

The algorithm provides three levels of current based on two levels of battery voltage.

The algorithm provides three levels of current based on two levels of battery voltage.

[Image: A graph illustrating the relationship between current limit and battery voltage, showing hysteresis for increasing and decreasing battery voltage.]

The power limiter can be applied to either PVDDL (one cell battery) or PVDDH (multi-cell battery). By default it is set on PVDDL and can be canged to PVDDH by using bit `PWR_LIM_SRC`.

### 8.4.10 Clocks

The device clocking is derived from the SBCLK input clock. The tables below show the valid SBCLK clock frequencies for each sample rate and SBCLK to FSYNC ratio.

If the sample rate is properly configured via the `SAMP_RATE[2:0]` register bits, no additional configuration is required as long as the SBCLK to FSYNC ratio is valid. The device will detect improper SBCLK frequencies and SBCLK to FSYNC ratios and volume ramp down the playback path to minimize audible artifacts. After the clock error is detected, the device will enter a low power halt mode after a time set by `CLK_HALT_TIMER[2:0]` register bits if `DIS_CLK_HALT` bit is low. Additionally, the device can automatically power up and down on valid clock signals if `CLK_PWRUD` register bit is set to high. The device sampling rate should not be changed on while this feature is enabled. In this mode the `DIS_CLK_HALT` bit register should be set low in order for this feature to work properly.

### 8.4.11 Ultrasonic

The TAS2781 has a dedicated power mode (PWR_MODE3) to play ultrasound in advance ultrasonic applications like presence detection, gesture recognition, etc.

When playing ultrasound it is recommended to set bits DEM_CTRL\[1:0\] to 3h and bit DIS_DITH to 1h.

In PWR_MODE3 mode of operation the output stage of Class-D will be supplied by external PVDDL rail.

### 8.4.12 Echo Reference

The TAS2781 can loop back the DSP output.

This feature allows user to do noise cancellation or echo correction algorithms.

A block diagram is presented in the figure below.

[Image: A block diagram showing the echo reference loopback, including components such as ASI Interface, Audio Engine, DAC Modulator, Decimation, VI Sense ADC, and Class D]

Figure 8-6. Echo Reference Loopback

The echo reference can be enabled by configuring AUDIO_TX register bit. The slot length and the time slot can be selected using AUDIO_SLEN and AUDIO_SLOT\[5:0\] register bits.

### 8.4.13 Hybrid-Pro External Boost Controller

The device has implemented an internal Hybrid-Pro algorithm allowing users to optimize the efficiency in the system by controlling the external power supply and maintaining just enough margin to provide high dynamic range without clipping distortions.

Features of Hybrid-Pro control:

## 8.4.13 Hybrid-Pro External Boost Controller

The device has implemented an internal Hybrid-Pro algorithm that allows users to optimize the efficiency in the system by controlling the external power supply and maintaining just enough margin to provide a high dynamic range without clipping distortions.

Features of Hybrid-Pro control:
- Optional 8 steps 384 kHz PWM format or 16 steps 192 kHz PWM format Hybrid-Pro control waveform for an external DC-DC converter.
- Configurable maximum 4 ms look-ahead audio signal delay buffer, which provides the capability to fit various application systems' DC-DC bandwidth and power supply coupling capacitance.
- Maximum 8 ms programmable audio signal peak hold to optimize power supply voltage rail transition from a large audio input to a small level, useful to avoid clipping distortions.
- Hybrid-Pro automatically adjusts the audio signal trigger level and each step level. Fine-tuning is available to achieve the balance between efficiency and envelope tracking speed.

When enabled, the controller generates at PWM_CTRL pin a signal with a duty cycle proportional to the peak voltage on the speaker. Using an external RC filter, the signal is converted to an analog voltage and can be used to control boost converters with feedback input.

The figure below shows how the PWM_CTRL pin can be connected to the external boost control RC network.

[Image: Diagram showing the connection of PWM_CTRL pin to an external boost control RC network]

### Figure 8-7. PWM_CTRL Pin and External Components

By default, the PWM_CTRL pin has an open-drain configuration, which allows for an easy implementation of a multi-channel control loop using only one RC circuitry, as shown in the figure below.

[Image: Diagram showing a multi-channel configuration using PWM_CTRL Pin]

### Figure 8-8. Multi-Channel Configuration using PWM_CTRL Pin

When only one device is controlling the boost converter, it is recommended to set the PWM_CTRL\[6\] bit to low. The PWM_CTRL pin will change configuration to a push-pull, and no pull-up resistor is required.

## 8.5 Operational Modes

### 8.5.1 Beep Generator

This tone generator produces a simple audio tone (beep) that is transmitted directly to the output (speaker).

The generator relies on a pulsed signal coming into either SDZ or NC_SCLK pin.

The beep generation is executed by pulsating any of these two pins with an input frequency f<sub>IN</sub> specified in.

The beep output signal will have a frequency given by:

f<sub>BEEP</sub> = f<sub>IN</sub>/64 for SDZ pin;  (3)

f<sub>BEEP</sub> = f<sub>IN</sub>/4 for NC_SCLK pin.  (4)

For example, if an 800 Hz beep is needed, input a 3.2 kHz PWM signal to pin NC_SCLK.

The beep generation can happen when the device is in Software Shutdown mode, by applying pulses on the pin. A deglitch timer will hold-off the shut-down functionality until the tone has finished and the deglitch timer has expired, in which case the pin will revert to controlling the hardware shutdown of the device (SDZ) or SPI clock (NC_SCLK).

The output power of the beep signal is controlled by the duty cycle of the input signal as described in the table below.

| Load (Ω) | Duty Cycle (%) | Output Power (W) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | 20 - 30 | 0.125 |
| 8 | 45 - 55 | 0.25 |
| 8 | 70 - 80 | 0.5 |

Note: When NC_SCLK pin is used for beeping, pin 17 should be connected to an 1.8 V supply (AVDD, IOVDD).

### 8.5.2 Hardware Shutdown

The device enters Hardware Shutdown mode if the SDZ pin is asserted low. In Hardware Shutdown mode, the device consumes the minimum quiescent current from AVDD, IOVDD, PVDDH, and PVDDL supplies. All registers lose state in this mode, and I<sup>2</sup>C or SPI communication is disabled.

By default, when SDZ pin goes low, the device will force a hardware shutdown after a timeout set by the configurable shutdown timer (register bits SDZ_TIMEOUT[1:0]). If SDZ is asserted low while audio is playing, the device will ramp down the volume of the audio, stop the Class-D switching, power down analog and digital blocks, and finally put the device into Hardware Shutdown mode. The device can also be configured for forced hardware shutdown, and in this case, it will not attempt to gracefully disable the audio channel. The shutdown mode can be controlled using SDZ_MODE[1:0] register bits.

When SDZ is released, the device will sample the ADDR pin and enter the Software Shutdown mode.

### 8.5.3 Mode Control and Software Reset

The TAS2781 mode can be configured by writing the MODE[2:0] register bits.

## 8.5.4 Software Shutdown
Software Shutdown mode powers down all analog blocks required to playback audio, but does not cause the device to lose register state.

The registers are available through I<sup>2</sup>C or SPI interface.

Software Shutdown is enabled by asserting the _MODE[2:0]_ register bits to 3'b010. If audio is playing when Software Shutdown is asserted, the Class-D will volume ramp down before shutting down. When de-asserted, the Class-D will begin switching and volume will ramp back to the programmed digital volume setting.

### 8.5.5 Mute Mode
The TAS2781 will ramp down volume of the Class-D amplifier to a mute state by setting the _MODE[2:0]_ register bits to 3'b001. During mute the Class-D still switches but transmits no audio content. If mute is de-asserted, the device will ramp volume back to the programmed digital setting.

### 8.5.6 Active Mode
In Active Mode the Class-D switches and plays back audio. Speaker voltage and current sensing are operational if enabled. Set the _MODE[2:0]_ register bits to 3'b000 to enter Active Mode.

### 8.5.7 Noise Gate Mode
In this mode of operation described in section **Section 8.4.2.8** the device monitors the signal and powers down the Class-D when signal goes below a threshold.

## 8.6 Faults and Status in TAS2781
During the power-up sequence, the circuit monitoring the AVDD pin (UVLO) will hold the device in reset (including all configuration registers) until the supply is valid. The device will not exit Hardware Shutdown until AVDD is valid and the SDZ pin is released. Once SDZ is released, the digital core voltage regulator will power up, enabling detection of the operational mode. If AVDD dips below the UVLO threshold, the device will immediately be forced into a reset state.

The device also monitors the PVDH supply and holds the analog core in power down if the supply is below the UVLO threshold (set by register bits _PVDH_UVLO_TH\[5:0_\]). If the TAS2781 is in active operation and an UVLO fault occurs, the analog blocks will immediately be powered down to protect the device. These faults are latched and require a transition through HW/SW shutdown to clear the fault. The latched registers will report UVLO faults.

When exiting Software Shutdown to Active (for example: _MODE\[2:0\]_ bits from 010b to 000b), if PVDH undervoltage is detected, the device will go back into Software Shutdown and an interrupt (IL_PUVLO) will be flagged. To exit this fault user needs to clear the interrupt and program the device in Software Shutdown using _MODE\[2:0\]_ bits, before making another attempt to go to Active mode.

A similar situation might occur in PWR_MODE2, if internal PVDL LDO undervoltage is detected and IL_LDO_UV interrupt is flagged.

The device transitions into Software Shutdown mode if it detects any faults with the TDM clocks such as:

*   Invalid SBCLK to FSYNC ratio
*   Invalid FSYNC frequency
*   Halting of SBCLK or FSYNC clocks

Upon detection of a TDM clock error, the device transitions into Software Shutdown mode as quickly as possible to limit the possibility of audio artifacts. Once all TDM clock errors are resolved, the device volume ramps back to its previous playback state. During a TDM clock error, the IRQZ pin will assert low if the clock error interrupt mask register bit _IM_TDMCE_ is set low. The clock fault is also available for read-back in the live or latched fault status registers (bits _IL_TDMCE_ and _IR_TDMCE_).

## Seamless Continuation of the Document

It is mandatory to have TDM clocks available before programming I²C to enter Active mode. Entering Active mode with no clocks present will trigger a clock error, device will go into software shutdown and the interrupts associated with the clock errors will be raised.

The TAS2781 also monitors die temperature and Class-D load current and will enter software shutdown mode if either of these exceed safe values. As with the TDM clock error, the IRQZ pin will assert low for these faults if the appropriate fault interrupt mask register bit is set low for over temperature and for over current. The fault status can also be monitored in the latched fault registers as with the TDM clock error.

Die over temperature and Class-D over current errors can either be latching (i.e. the device will enter Software Shutdown until a HW/SW shutdown sequence is applied) or they can be configured to automatically retry after a prescribed time. This behavior can be configured in the OTE_RETRY and OCE_RETRY register bits (for over temperature and over current). Even in latched mode, the Class-D will not attempt to retry after an over temperature or over current error until the retry time period (Default = 1.5 s) has elapsed. This prevents applying repeated stress to the device in a rapid fashion that could lead to device damage. If the device has been cycled through SW/HW shutdown, the device will only begin to operate after the retry time period. By default the RETRY feature is disabled.

The status registers (and IRQZ pin if enabled, and for un-masked interrupts) also indicate limiter behavior including when the limiter is activated, when PVDDH is below the inflection point, when maximum attenuation has been applied, when the limiter is in infinite hold and when the limiter has muted the audio.

In the situations when the device operates in PWR_MODE2 the PVDL pin is supplied by an internal LDO. Protection circuits monitor this block and generate faults in case of under voltage, over voltage or if the LDO is over loaded. The device goes into shut down if one of these faults triggers.

The IRQZ pin is an open drain output that asserts low during unmasked fault conditions and therefore must be pulled up with a resistor to IOVDD. An internal 20 kΩ pull up resistor is provided. It can be accessed by setting the IRQZ_PU register bit of Register 0x04 to high.

The IRQZ interrupt configuration can be set using IRQZ_CFG[1:0] register bits in Register 0x5C. The IRQZ_POL register bit sets the interrupt polarity and IRQZ_CLR register bit allows to clear all the interrupt latch register bits.

Live flag registers are active only when the device is in Active mode of operation. If the device is in Software Shutdown by I²C command or due to any fault condition described below, the live flags will be reset. Latched flags will not be reset in this condition and available for user to read their status.

### 8.7 Power Sequencing Requirements

There are no power sequencing requirements for order of rate of ramping up or down as long as SDZ pin is kept low.

### 8.8 Digital Input Pull Downs

The I²S/TDM interface pins and the ICC pin have optional weak pull down resistors to prevent the pins from floating. Register bits DIN_PD[4:0] from are used to enable/disable pull downs. The pull downs are not enabled during Hardware Shutdown.

## 11 Power Supply Recommendations

The power sequence between the supply rails can be applied in any order as long as SDZ pin is held low. Once all supplies are stable the SDZ pin can be set high to initialize the part. After a hardware or software reset additional commands to the device should be delayed for at least 1 ms to allow the OTP memory to load (see section Section 10).

When PVDDL is internally generated (see **Section 11.1**) it is recommended that the device enters Software Shutdown mode before entering Hardware Shutdown mode. This ensures that PVDDL pin is discharged using the internal 5 kOhms pull down resistor (not present in Hardware Shutdown mode).

### 11.1 Power Supply Modes

The TAS2781 can operate with both PVDDL and PVDDH as supplies or with only PVDDH or PVDDL as supply. The table below shows different power supply modes of operation depending on the user need.

| Supply Power Mode | Output Switching Mode | Supply Condition | PVDL Mode | Device Configurations | Use Case and Device Functionality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PWR_MODE0 | High Power on PVDDH | PVDDH>PVDDL | External | PVDDL_MODE=0 CDS_MODE[1:0]=10 | PVDDH is the only supply used to deliver output power. |
| PWR_MODE1 | Y Bridge - High Power on PVDDL | PVDDH | External | PVDDL_MODE=0 CDS_MODE[1:0]=00 | PVDDL is used to deliver output power based on level and headroom configured. When audio signal crosses a programmed threshold Class-D output is switched over VDDH. |
| PWR_MODE2 | Y Bridge - Low Power on PVDDL | PVDDH | Internal | PVDDL_MODE=1 CDS_MODE[1:0]=11 | PVDDH is the only supply. PVDDL is delivered by an internal LDO and used to supply at signals close to idle channel levels. When audio signal levels crosses (default -100dBFS), Class-D output switches to PVDDH. |
| PWR_MODE3 | PVDDL | PVDDL | External | PVDDL_MODE=0 CDS_MODE[1:0]=01 | The device can be forced to work out of a low power rail mode of operation. For example this can be used for a low power ultrasonic chirp when audio is not played. |

When PVDDL is external (PWR_MODE0, PWR_MODE1), if PVDDH falls below (PVDDL +2.5 V) level, the Y-bridge will stop switching between supplies and will remain on the PVDDH supply.

In PWR_MODE2 user needs to ensure that PVDDH supply level is at least 2.5 V above the PVDDL voltage generated internally in order to take advantage of Y bridge mode of operation. To enable voltage protection the under voltage threshold of PVDDH supply should be set above 7.3 V by using register bits PVDD_UVLO\[5:0]. This will ensure that, with an internally generated PVDDL of 4.8 V, PVDDH supply is at least 2.5 V higher than PVDDL.

## 12 Layout
## 12.1 Layout Guidelines

All supply rails should be bypassed by low-ESR ceramic capacitors as shown and described in Section 9.2.

To create a low impedance connection to PGND, DGND and GND and minimize the ground noise, ground planes with multiple conductive epoxy filled vias should be used in layout.

Specific layout design recommendations should be followed for this device:
*   Use wide traces for signals that carry high current: PVDDH, PVDDL, PGND, DGND, GND and the speaker OUTP, OUTN.
*   PGND pin should be directly connected and shorted to the ground plane.
*   DGND pin should be directly connected to the ground plane.
*   Connect VSNSP and VSNSN as close as possible to the speaker.
*   VSNSP and VSNSN should be connected between the EMI ferrite filter and the speaker if EMI ferrites are used at the outputs.
*   VSNSP and VSNSN routing should be separated and shielded from switching signals (interface signals, speaker outputs, bootstrap pins).
*   Place bootstrap capacitors as close as possible to the BST pins.
*   Place decoupling capacitors of PVDDH and PVDDL as close as possible to the pins (see Section 12.2).

## 12.3 Thermal and Power Information
Thermal and power information is critical for the PCB design. This section explains how to optimize the PCB layout for thermal performance.

[Image: a diagram showing thermal and power information]

### 12.3.1 PCB Design Considerations for Thermal Performance

To achieve optimal thermal performance, the following PCB design considerations must be taken into account:

*   Use thermal vias to dissipate heat from the device.
*   Increase the copper thickness to improve thermal conductivity.
*   Use a large ground plane to dissipate heat.

By following these guidelines, the PCB layout can be optimized for thermal performance, ensuring reliable operation of the device.

### 12.4 Conclusion

In conclusion, a well-designed PCB layout is crucial for the optimal performance of the device. By following the guidelines outlined in this document, designers can create a PCB layout that meets the thermal and power requirements of the device.
